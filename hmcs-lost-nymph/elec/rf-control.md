RF Control
==========

Currently I only own a few Taranis RC transmitters. They are all using the 2.4 GHz band, which does not penetrate water at all. They do support very advanced features, including scripting, and support plugin modules that can transmit on other frequencies.

According to [this forum post on SubCommittee.com](https://subcommittee.com/forum/showthread.php?32640-433mhz-links-and-info-\(Tim-s-Regatta-Seminar&highlight=orangerx), a 433 MHz transmitter outputting only 6 mW can penetrate 1 meter of water.

For the receiver, it's better for me to simply buy a HopeRF RFM22B, and attach my own microcontroller to it.
