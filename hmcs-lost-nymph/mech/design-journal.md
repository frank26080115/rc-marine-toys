=========================

The decision to make the submarine resemble a Los Angeles class SSN is because this class has a simplistic look. Making a realistic scale model is not priority.

The decision to use twin propellers without rudders is for simplicity. Plus, rudders only work while in forward motion.

The decision to use a WTC (water tight cylinder) as the housing is because it is easy to seal with just end-caps and o-rings. No adhesives or custom shaped gaskets are required. The tube should be polycarbonate for strength, it is transparent, and more importantly, less prone to cracking than acrylic.

The diameter of the WTC tube is chosen to be 2.5 inches. This allows two 36mm propellers, and their driving motors, to fit side by side. The parts to implement this drive system is easily purchased from Amazon. The WTC tube can be purchased from McMaster-Carr.

With the WTC tube diameter chosen, the length is determined by the shape of the Los Angeles class SSN. The full length of the submarine should be about 600mm long, and the WTC tube should be about 450mm long.

There is two threaded rods running along the inside of the WTC tube. Internal components of the submarine, such as the pump, battery, and ballast, are placed along these rods with the help of 3D printed parts. This way allows for easy rearrangement and movement of these parts, which allows for the submarine center-of-gravity to be shifted easily. Ideally, the submarine is level when it is surfaced, and when it is underwater, the ballast bladder is at the center-of-gravity.

The drive motors should be 280 sized DC brushed motors, but the design can be easily adjusted to use 130 sized motors as well.

The diving action is done with a ballast system consisting of a bladder made of a balloon, and a peristaltic pump. The peristaltic pump allows the system to pump bidirectionally without the usage of any valves. The downside is that there's no safety, no redundancy, and the entire WTC must be airtight. The usage of a balloon bladder, instead of a water chamber, is to make it easy to shift the position of the ballast, and it requires no additional sealing against the WTC walls. As I am not very experienced, I am avoiding the use of valves, compressed air, and pistons.

If the bladder takes up 50% of the WTC's volume, then the air pressure will rise by 1 atm, roughly 14.7 PSI. The front and rear end-caps have a surface area of 7.85 sq-in. This means each end-cap will be under 115.4 lbs of force. Each end-cap will be secured to the WTC with three M3 screws radially. It is highly unlikely that the bladder will be filled to that extent.

The outer hull of the submarine is 3D printed in 6 sections that magnetically attach to each other. The bow and stern are also 3D printed, and are attached to the WTC using screws. The hull pieces do not need to be waterproof.
