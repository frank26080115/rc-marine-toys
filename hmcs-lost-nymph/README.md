HMCS Lost Nymph
===============

This is a simple RC submarine

 * Total length 600mm
 * Polycarbonate WTC 2.5 inch I.D.
 * Dual drive, differential thrust steering
 * Static diving capable, using bladder ballast and peristaltic pump
 * 3D printed shell, magnetically attached, roughly resembles Los Angeles class SSN
 * RF control over 433 MHz radio band
 * No servos

This is my first RC submarine build, so this is a massive learning experience.
